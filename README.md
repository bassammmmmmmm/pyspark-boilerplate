#PySpark BoilderPlate

##Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

A Databricks workspace
An Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 or Gen2 account with the necessary permissions to read and write data
An ADLS configuration file that contains the account name, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret
##Step 1: Create a new Databricks notebook
Open the Databricks workspace and click on the "Workspace" button in the left-hand sidebar.

Navigate to the folder where you want to create the new notebook.

Click on the "Create" button and select "Notebook".

Give the notebook a name and select the appropriate language (Python 3).

Click "Create".

##Step 2: Upload the project files
Download the PySpark ETL pipeline project files from the Git repository.

In the Databricks workspace, navigate to the folder where you want to upload the project files.

Click on the "Import" button and select "File".

Choose the project files that you downloaded and click "Open".

Wait for the files to upload.

##Step 3: Install Python dependencies
In the Databricks notebook, create a new cell.

Run the following command to install the Python dependencies required for the project:

shell
Copy code
%pip install -r /dbfs/path/to/requirements.txt
Replace /dbfs/path/to/requirements.txt with the actual path to the requirements.txt file in your Databricks workspace.

Wait for the dependencies to install.

##Step 4: Configure the ADLS connection
In the Databricks workspace, navigate to the config folder in the project files.

Open the adls_config.json file.

Replace the placeholder values with the actual values for your ADLS account:

json
Copy code
{
  "account_name": "<ADLS_ACCOUNT_NAME>",
  "tenant_id": "<TENANT_ID>",
  "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>"
}
Save the file.

##Step 5: Run the PySpark job files
In the Databricks notebook, create a new cell.

Run the following command to submit the etl_job.py PySpark job file:

shell
Copy code
%run /dbfs/path/to/etl_job.py
Replace /dbfs/path/to/etl_job.py with the actual path to the etl_job.py file in your Databricks workspace.

Wait for the job to complete.

##Step 6: Verify the results
In the Databricks workspace, navigate to the data/output folder in the project files.

Verify that the output data files were generated successfully.

Optionally, you can create additional PySpark job files to perform data transformations, data validation, and data loading.

That's it! By following these steps, you can use the PySpark ETL pipeline project in Databricks and read/write files to ADLS. Remember to update the ADLS configuration file with the appropriate values for your ADLS account and ensure that the required Python dependencies are installed.
